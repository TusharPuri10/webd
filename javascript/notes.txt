writing code in 0 and 1 is hard
we made  a language ( Assembly ) ( High Level Language in respect of 0's & 1's) and a compiler to convert the programming language to 0 and 1's.

Scripting language of web, meant to be only understood by browser.
was JavaScript.

Engine for Chrome, Firefox, Safari has to keep up with ECMAScriptStandard.


Engine of browser responsible for converting JS and machine level language.

They (Chrome, Firefox...)  each have their own unique version of engine.

Node js is a Engine/JavaScript runtime which google wrote and now it is used by everyone now.
