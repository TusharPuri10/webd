where can Js run

Browser ( first people for whom js engine were made and then google came up with node js)
Data centers
Flight TV
mobile Devices

Javascript is single Threaded

How many cores you have in your machine ???
suppose 9 cores in machine.
a core is like a place where your code can execute
The more cores, the more powerful machine.

JS written to be a single threaded, it will only use a single core so in aws if using js then buy only one core machine.
sp we can say that js is very powerless machine.

cannot delegate tasks in other threads.
But there's some hack to do it. >>>interview answer is NO.

Javasript is asynchronours

harkirat talkin talkin talkin....bro stop go get me a chocolate(complex task in between)...come back and teach for another hour.

what if harkirat said He'll send my friend!!!!...BUT harkira ( node js program ) you can not run parallely.

Harkirat said that's my (node js's) asynchronous nature.... His friend is bringing the chocolate meanwhile he is teaching us.

It can't be like Harkirat will teach only after his friend will brought chocolate, It will not be asynchronous
HOW TO DO THIS ????? How to utilise this asynchronous natue of js?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>CALLBACKS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ( check in script_06.js )


Javascript is loosely typed ( helps beginners )

Javascript is interpretted language ( Bro I'll go line by line, start executing from top if I'll get error I'll stop )

C++ is compiled language, first it will compile(process of rechecking) (stage for running)

If javascript will be compiled then lot's of website would break

Native JS code<<<<<<<<<<

var x = 2;
Date
Function
Classes
For loops

APIs<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Exposed by the runtime enviornment

every hardware of nodejs get exposed with such APIs and we use them for our need
fetch
setTimeout
setInterval
fs.read
